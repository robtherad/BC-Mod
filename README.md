akm_tracers
* Fixes RHS 7.62x39 Tracer mag. Actually has a magazine full of tracer rounds now.

common
* Contains some functions that were part of the mission template in the `misc` folder.

#### Plans
In no particular order.

* Move common BC functions to addon.
* Create module system that can be used instead of/alongside `setGroupID`
* Create nicer looking map markers
* Rewrite GPS marker system for use in non Fight Night missions as well.
* Rewrite Radio system for use in non Fight Night missions as wel.
* Port spectator script to addon so it's easier to update.
* Upload mod to workshop after it's more useful?
