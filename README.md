* A recreation of the gpsmarkers module from BC mission template.

main
* The root of the addon. Contains macros and other stuff used throughout the rest of the addon.

marker_tracker (WIP)
* Allows admins to see who is placing and deleting markers during the briefing phase.
```
### Plans
In no particular order.

* Move common BC functions to addon.
* Create module system that can be used instead of/alongside `setGroupID`
* Create nicer looking map markers
* Rewrite Radio system for use in non Fight Night missions as well.
* Port spectator script to addon so it's easier to update.
* Upload mod to workshop after it's more useful?
