## objectives.pbo

Makes objective creation as simple as placing a module in the editor and syncing it to either the object or trigger related to the objective.

#### Module Types
**Time Left** - Easy to set up time limit for missions
**Destroy** - Creates a task for attacking teams to destroy the synced object. Can be configured to create a matching task for defending teams as weel.
(Not Implemented) **Escape** (To/From?) - Synced units need to escape to/from the trigger (or marker?) area to complete the objective. Can be used as a retreat point maybe?
(Not Implemented) **Capture** - Synced units need to control the synced trigger (or marker?) area to complete the objective. Control of the area is defined by the module parameters. Options for majority, complete control? Might not even be worth making, just use BI sector system.
